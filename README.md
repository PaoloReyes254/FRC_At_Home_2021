# WINT 3794 FRC AT HOME 0$ ROBOT IDEA

The initial idea is to create a competitive robot that can accomplish all FIRST at home challenges with a 0 dollars budget.

The chasis will be the same as WinT 3794 FRC 2020 robot with the only change of pneumatic wheels to HiGrip 6 inches wheels.

The chasis consist of 6 NEO motors (3 per side) chain driven with 2 REV throughBore encoders at the lasts wheels to perform autonomous tasks using diferential equations.

Now let's approach how to improve this robot to accomplish all First At Home tasks.

# Galactic Search Challenge

"In the Galactic Search challenge, teams emulate the Autonomous Period of INFINITE RECHARGE
gameplay by locating and collecting POWER CELLS as fast as they can on one of two (2) pairs of paths."

IMPORTANT RULES

"GSC2. Teams must randomly determine (e.g. coin, die, phone app, etc.) if they run the red or blue paths.
Teams make a single random determination and then run the same color on both paths.
The intent is that teams do not signal directly to the ROBOT which option has been
chosen. Placement of the ROBOT is not considered signaling."
